**Figure S1 | Supplementary images from the paddy field survey in 2017**  
(**a**) Study site layout including two rice paddy fields: "conventional" and "no-Fertilizer." The two paddy fields are separated by ridges, and we set a 3 m $\times$ 15 m plot in each paddy field (indicated by a red rectangle) with a 2-m buffer zone between the plot and the ridge. Each 3 m $\times$ 15 m plot was divided into five sections (separated by dashed red lines in each plot), with each section covering an area of 3 m $\times$ 3 m. Water samples were collected from all the five sections in each plot to monitor the ecological communities, and the performance of  rice individuals were monitored (e.g., rice heights, SPAD, and the numbers of stems and heads) at the same locations. We also set five sampling points on the ridge (indicated by the red circles). We set sticky panels for collecting insects and 50 cm $\times$ 50 cm quadrats for monitoring wild weeds. (**b**) Sticky panels for insect monitoring (30 August 2017; &copy;M. Ushio). (**c**) Plant coverage survey (5 July 2017; &copy;M. Ushio). Each grid corresponds to 10 cm $\times$ 10 cm. (**d**) Yield survey in September 2017 (&copy;S. Yoshinami). (**e**) Rice heads before harvesting (&copy;S. Yoshinami).
